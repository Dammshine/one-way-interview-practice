**LIVE WEBSITE AT:** 

https://dinesh-kalamegam.github.io/one-way-interview-practice/

## ‚Ñπ What is this? 
A website for OnDemand Interview practice such as Hirevue, Sonru or whatever other one way interview platform where you record yourself answering a question. 

#### Steps to use the website
1) Enable the microphone and camera on your device
2) Allow the website to access the microphone and camera 
3) Choose a question through the tab menu
4) Click on "Turn my camera ON" to get ready - you should be able to see your camera feed at this point
5) Set your Countdown Timer and Recording Time Limit 
6) OPTIONALLY - There is some space provided if you want to make some notes to help plan out an answer
7) When you are ready press the record button and start answering
8) Once you are done you can choose another question, or practice the same one the choice is yours

## Who is this for / Why I made this
Many companies use these Hirevue video interviews as one of the many hoops you need to jump before getting to talk to an actual person. 

I personally found these type of interviews to be uncomfortable and off-putting so I mainly made this website for myself in order to feel better prepared. 

The website has been open sourced in the hopes that it may provide some value for you too in the following ways:

1) Providing a collection of questions to practice - just like how you would leetcode for a hackerrank. 
   
2) To help you feel more comfortable delivering a response on camera by providing instant playback after you have finished recording your response.
   
3) Though the functionality is crude - on desktop if you right click the video after recording you'd get an option to save the video. This could be useful if you want to send it someone to get a second opinion 

## Contributing 
To start off I added some general behaviour questions then arbitrarily chose Product Management as another category of questions. As such any suggestions are welcome for questions / question categories are welcome so feel free to open a issue about this

Any feedback about the design or features you want to see are also welcome

## Technical Details
