# One Way Interview Practice 
**LIVE WEBSITE AT:** 

https://dinesh-kalamegam.github.io/one-way-interview-practice/

## What is this? 
A website for Hirevue Practice or any other one way interview platforms where you record yourself answering a question

Simply choose a question, countdown time and question time limit then you should be good to go.

Right now I think the bare bone functionality works. 

Not much thought has been put into the design yet (perhaps something with a corporate aesthetic) so overtime the UI should improve and more questions I find on GitHub will be added
