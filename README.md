# One Way Interview Practice 
**LIVE WEBSITE AT:**

## What is this? 
A website for OnDemand Interview practice such as Hirevue, Sonru or whatever other one way interview platform where you record yourself answering a question. 

Simply choose a question, countdown time and question time limit then you should be good to go.

**UPDATE AS OF 07/07/2021** : Just completed a major UI overhaul - I figured it would be simpler if a user can just change the question directly from the question page instead of going back to the homepage. This ends up simplifying the design so there are only two pages
1) The Landing Page
2) The Question Page 

Doing this also decoupled the two pages so the question page doesn't need a prop from the home page anymore nor does the homepage need the JSON file of questions.
